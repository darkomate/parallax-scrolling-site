# Parallax Scrolling Website
This is a simple and rather crude implementation of a Parallax Scrolling Website. Requires abit of work to make it stunning but the core fundamental code is in place as the starting point.

## Getting Started
Simply clone the repo and use Python local server to run the code.
````bash
git clone https://github.com/darkomate/parallax-scrolling-site
cd parallax-scrolling-site
python3 -m http.server
